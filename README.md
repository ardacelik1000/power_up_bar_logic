# Power Up Bar Logic - Ball Physics Python
This project is a Python-based ball physics game created using the Pygame library. The game provides an interactive experience where players can control the power and angle of a ball to navigate obstacles and reach specific targets.

Features:

-Ball Physics: The game incorporates realistic ball physics, including gravity, bouncing, and friction, to create an immersive gaming experience.

-Power Bar: A dynamic power bar allows players to adjust the power of their shots based on their desired trajectory and distance.

-Angle Adjustment: Players can control the angle of their shots using an intuitive interface, providing a high level of control over the ball's trajectory.

-Interactive Environment: The game features interactive elements such as walls and obstacles, challenging players to strategize their moves and plan their shots carefully.

-Visual Feedback: Visual cues, such as arrow indicators, provide players with real-time feedback, helping them gauge the direction and strength of their shots.

-Customizable Settings: The game allows for customization of various parameters, including ball color, mass, and friction, offering players the flexibility to tailor their gaming experience.

How to Play:

-Launch the Game: Run the Python script to launch the game window.

-Adjust Power and Angle: Use the power bar to adjust the strength of your shot and the angle indicator to control the trajectory.

-Navigate Obstacles: Navigate the ball through the environment, avoiding obstacles and using walls strategically to reach the target.

-Winning Condition: Reach the designated target area to win the game and advance to the next level.
